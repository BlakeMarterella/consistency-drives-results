## Selecting a color pallete

The premise of this application is to reinforce responsability and consistency. To that end, I used this [color meaning chart](https://www.color-meanings.com/color-symbolism-chart/) to try and find which colors I should use throuhgout my design. Ideally, I would like a color pallete that can work well with light/dark modes and reinforce the purpose of this application. I chose blue, which represents security, trust, loyalty, and responsability, and black as a symbol of power, elegance, and sophistication. I will also be using some white as a symbol of purity, cleanliness, and simplicity. I used this pallete that was randomly generated on [Coolors](https://coolors.co/04080f-507dbc-a1c6ea-bbd1ea-dae3e5) as a starting point and updated my `tailwind.config.js` file to reflect these colors.
